Hi, my name is Matias Fazzolari, this is my personal github account and as you may see, is empty.
Why? Because, long time ago, private repositories where free only on Bitbucket, and that's all.

Are you the same mfazzolariTC, FA-matiasfazzolari and SCV-MatiasFazzolari, yes, cause I don't mix
business and pleasure (or cause was a client requirement, and now I can't delete the accounts)

Will I share code here? Unlikely to happen.

Do I code on my free time? No way, I like to play videogames or being outdoors, running, walking, etc. 
If some day I feel I that have an idea for a project, be sure it will be a private repo.

Anyways, I got a big project in progress: finishing a 100 miles trail running race.
