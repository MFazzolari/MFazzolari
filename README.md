Hi, my name is Matias Fazzolari, this is my personal github account and as you may see, is empty.
Why? Because, long time ago, private repositories where free only on Bitbucket, and that's all.

Are you the same mfazzolariTC, FA-matiasfazzolari and SCV-MatiasFazzolari, yes, cause I don't like
business and pleasure (or cause a client required the account, and now I can't delete them)

Will I share code here? Unlikely to happen. 

Do I code on my free time? No way, I like to play videogames or being outdoors, running, walking, etc. 
If some day I feel I that have an idea for a project, be sure it will be a private repo.

Anyways, I got a big project in progress: finishing a 100 miles trail running race.
